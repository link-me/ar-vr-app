CC0 Textures Placeholder

Drop your CC0 textures here to be used by the game:
- food.png   — green-themed texture for Food
- spikes.png — hazard/warning stripes texture for Spikes

How it works:
- If these files exist, the scripts load them automatically.
- If not, the game will fall back to procedural textures.
